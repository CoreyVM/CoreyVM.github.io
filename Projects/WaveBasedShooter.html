        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        As part of my teaching curriculum with my profession as an Advanced Technical Lecturer, I had the luxury of delivering a bespoke
        course for my students studying game development. For my learners, I wanted to give them lessons that would enable them to take the skills
        learnt from my sessions and apply these to their own projects, regardless of genre or game engine.<br><br>
        With this in mind, I decided to produce a 10+ week course where the learners will build a First Person Wave-Based Shooter Game from scratch. On this course,
        the learners were shown and taught how to design and create the appropriate systems required to develop their games. For example, how a weapon system
        is designed and created using OOP principles for code reusability and modularity. Moreover, they were introduced to

        <h2>System Functionality</h2>
        <p>
           For this course I delivered, the end goal was to create a working first-person shooter project
           that works very similarly to that of Treyarch Call Of Duty Zombies mode, where infinite 
           waves of spawning artificial intelligence will chase and attack the player, and you have 
           to survive for as long as possible.

          For this game project, I broke down the course into these sections until the learners were able 
          to build a fully functional prototype. These were:
            <ul>
                <li>Creating the Gun Super Class</li>
                <li>Creating virtual functions for Gun class</li>
                <li>Importing and configuring Skeletal Meshes </li>
                <li>Bone Socketing for Weapon Attach System</li>
                <li>Finite & Behaviour Tree Artificial Intelligence</li>
                <li>Dynamic Zone AI Spawning System</li>
            </ul>       
        </p>
        For the spawning of artificial intelligence, instead of utilising a random spawn location in the range system. Instead, I 
        took inspiration from Call of Duty & Killing Floor for how their artificial intelligence is spawned within the world.
        From my observations, 
        I concluded that these games may use a zone-based system for determining what active zones the player is currently standing in.<br><br>

            <div class="sysfunc-description">
              <h4>Zone Based Spawning System</h4>
          The zone-based system I devised works by having hidden colliders within a 3D environment, with each collider there are 
          spawner point actor in an array located in the colliders class. Once the player steps into these zones, then my 
          game mode will determine which spawning points are currently 'active', then using random number generation
          the spawning system will choose from one of the active locations to make a dynamic spawn system. <br><br>

          To teach my learners about performance, this spawning system has restrictions in place, these restrictions
          are that the AI cannot spawn past that max quantity by a variable limit. This ensures that there will 
          not be too many calls on the CPU and GPU with extensive amounts of usage and calls.<br><br>

          <h4>Inverse Kinematics System</h4>
          For the weapon system to save on development time, instead of creating additional animations per weapon. For this 
          I devised an Inverse Kinematics system so that the left-hand bone of the player's skeletal mesh would be attached to a custom
          bone socket per weapon skeleton. As seen in the preview, by simply moving the position of said bone in the weapon skeleton, this will dynamically
          adjust the skeletal mesh to better snap and position for each weapon animation set.
