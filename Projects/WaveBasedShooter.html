        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        As part of my teaching curriculum with my proffession as an Advanced Technical Lecturer I had the luxury of delivering a bespoke
        course for my students studying game development. For my learners I wanted to give them lessons that would enable them to take the skills
        learnt from my sessions and apply these into their own projects regardless of genre or game engine.<br><br>

        With this in mind I decided to produce a 10+ week course where the learners will build a First Person Wave Based Shooter Game from scratch. On this course
        the learners were shown and taught how to design and create the appropirate systems required to develop their games. For example, how a weapon system
        is designed and created using OOP principles for code reusuablity and modulartity. Moreover, they were introuced to 
        
        <ul>
          <li>Gameplay Systems</li>
          <li>Artifical Intelligence</li>
          <li>User Interface & UX</li>
          <li>Skeletal Animation Programming</li>
          <li>Inverse Kinematics</li>
          <li>Shaders & PArticle Systems</li>
          <li>Post Processing</li>
          <li>Audio Systems</li>
        <ul>
        </p>

        <h2>System Functionality</h2>
        <p>
          


           For this course I delivered, the end goal was to create a working First Person Shooter project
           that works very similialry to that of Treyarch Call Of Duty Zombies mode, where infinite 
           waves of spawning artiticla intelligence will chase and attack the player and you have 
           to surivive for as long as possible.

          For this game project I was delivering I broke down the course into these section until the learners were able 
          to build a fully functional protoype. These were:
            <ul>
                <li>Creating the Gun Super Class</li>
                <li>Creating virtual functions for Gun class</li>
                <li>Importing and configriung Skeletal Meshes </li>
                <li>Bone Socketing For Weapon Attach System</li>
                <li>Finite & Behaviour Tree Artifical Intelligence</li>
                <li>Dynamic Zone AI Spawning System</li>
            </ul>       
        </p>



        For the spawning of artifical intellgence instead of utilsing a random spawn location in range system. Instead I 
        took insipiration from Call of Duty & Killing Floor for how their artifical intelligence is spawned within the world.
        From my obersvations I conclude that these games may use a zone based system for determining what active zones the player is currently
        standing in.<br><br>

            <div class="sysfunc-description">
              <h4>Zone Based Spawning System</h4>
              The zone based system i devised works by having hidden colliders within a 3D enviornment with each collider there are 
          spawner point actor in an array located on the colliders class. Once the player steps into these zones then my 
          game mode will determine which spawning points are currently 'active' then using random number generation
          the spawning system will choose of the active locations to make a dynamic system. <br><br>

          To teach my learners about performance this spawning system has restriction in place, these retriscrtion
          are that the AI cannot spawn past that max quaintiy by a variable limit. This ensures that there will 
          not be to many calls on the CPU and GPU with extensive amounts of usage and calls.<br><br>

         <div class="sysfunc-description">
          <h4>Inverse Kinematics System</h4>
          For the weapon system in order to save on development time, instead of creating additonal animations per weapon. For this 
          I devised an Inverse Kinematics system so that the left hand bone of the players skeletal mesh would be attacthed to a custom
          bone socket per weapon skeleton. As seen in the preview by simply moving the position of said bone in the weapon skeleton this will dynamically
          adjust the skeltal mesh to better snap and position for each weapon animation set.
