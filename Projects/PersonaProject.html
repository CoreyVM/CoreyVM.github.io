        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        This project started as a challenge to myself, as during my Masters Degree I had learnt the C++ programming language, I wanted to intergate my C++ skillset
        into the Unreal Engine. As an avid fan of Survival Horror games and espcially Resident Evil 2. I wanted to recreate the inventory system from scrath using C++ and 
        blueprints for Widgets (User Interface).
        
        Its purpose was not to create a beautiful user interface, but to recreate all the logic required.

            The functinality of this sytem is as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Adding Items</li>
             
            </ul>

        <h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
           <p>
            From this project I have learned the importance of planning the overall data strcuture and class structure for creating Object Orietned
            programs. Additonally, the usage of Vectors and for loops for correct iteraions in C++ with my bespoke sysetm. Regarding the overall
            implemetantio I put into practise a Top Down apporach to problem solving to dissect the core progralm i was trying to solve and all 
            the required elements needed to complete this sytem. Whilst this is one of my oldest projects to date and there are various issues
            that i have with the code structure, I would still consider it a great learning expereince and the project was able to meet the requiremtsn that I 
            had set out for myself.
