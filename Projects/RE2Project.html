        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        This project started as a challenge to myself, as during my Masters Degree I had learnt the C++ programming language, I wanted to intergate my C++ skillset
        into the Unreal Engine. As an avid fan of Survival Horror games and espcially Resident Evil 2. I wanted to recreate the inventory system from scrath using C++ and 
        blueprints for Widgets (User Interface).
        
        Its purpose was not to create a beautiful user interface, but to recreate all the logic required.

        <h2>System Functionality</h2>
        <p>
            The functionality of this system is as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Adding Items</li>
                <li>Removing Items (Except Key Items)</li>
                <li>Using Items</li>
                <li>Examining Items</li>
                <li>Attaching equipable items to the player</li>
                <li>Storing and retrieving items from an item box</li>
                <li>Item stack data for reloading</li>
                <li>Combining Ingredients</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <div class="ref-content">  
             Looking back at this project (created in 2020), this was my first genuine attempt at utilising C++ outside my studies for my Master's Degree.
            Upon reflection, many things could have improved this system overall.
            For starters, the logic for the inventory system is primarily written inside the player character .cpp file. Implementing my program this way made for a bloated and inefficient system.
            To rectify this, I would create a new class that is only used for the logic of the inventory system; This would, for one, remove the bloated player class,
            two, this would modularise and aid in the debugging process. </br>
        </div>



        <div class="ref-container">
        <div class="ref-description">
            Then, using either a singleton method or simply storing the class as a member variable inside the player character, they can still access all its contents without needing to write any
            additional functionality within its class. </br><br>
                
            Furthermore, there are some issues with the overall code structure for looking for items. Evidence of this can be seen in the GetAmmoInInventory function, 
            as there are two for loops inside this single function. 
            To rectify this, I could have restructured and rewritten this to a single loop or return call to avoid excessive memory usage for a single function call. <br><br>

            Moreover, there was a lack of interfaces utilised within the codebase. The evidence of a missing interface was apparent within the switch case for using an item; 
            during the development of the prototype, this wasn't an issue. However, for scalability and maintainability, 
            this is not an ideal solution as the more items added to this system would require constantly
            adding to the switch case, whereas adding an interface call to that specific used item would increase code readability and make it more modular. <br>

        <h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
           <p>
            From this project, I have learned the importance of planning the overall data structure and class structure for creating object-oriented
            programs. Additionally, the usage of Vectors and for loops for correct iterations in C++ with my bespoke system. Regarding the overall
            implementation, I put into practice a top-down approach to problem solving to dissect the core program I was trying to solve and all 
            the required elements needed to complete this system. Whilst this is one of my oldest projects to date, and there are various issues
            that I have with the code structure, I would still consider it a great learning experience, and the project was able to meet the requirements that I 
            had set out for myself.
